# Open UPM: Quick Git Utility  

This tool is a bit rough around the edges...  but I’ve been using it since I created it.
I ashamed to share it as it’s not well-tested and the code is messy.  

However, it allows you to use Git directly within Unity.  
When paired with the Unity Package Manager, it’s quite powerful.  

Feel free to use it if it suits your needs.

**Required:** Git install on Window.
